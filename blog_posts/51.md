## Learn Objective-C Lesson 4: if() statements and Booleans

As [mentioned before](49.md), boolean values are simply true-or-false. In Objective-C, unlike many other languages, they are represented as `YES` or `NO`:

```
BOOL trueOrFalse = YES;
BOOL gameOver = NO;
```

Internally, however, they are stored as zero and one.

### if() Statements

The if() statement is used to check for conditions. Just like we use if in normal English, if() in code is used to test for a condition- they test for the value of a boolean (or any int—in this case, a zero is considered false; any non-zero value is true).

Here is a simple example of booleans:

```objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

int main (int argc, const char *argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        BOOL trueOrFalse = YES;
        if (trueOrFalse)
            NSLog(@"trueOrFalse is true.");
        if (1)
            NSLog(@"1 is considered to be true.");
        }
    return 0;
}
```

The output is:

```
trueOrFalse is true.
1 is considered to be true.
Simple enough, and quite logical.
```

Obviously, if the condition was false, the statements following would not be executed. The following example demonstrates:

```objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

int main (int argc, const char *argv[]) {
   @autoreleasepool {

        BOOL trueOrFalse = YES;
        if (trueOrFalse)
            NSLog(@"trueOrFalse is true.");
        if (1)
            NSLog(@"1 is considered to be true.");    // If false, statement following is not executed
        trueOrFalse = NO;
        if (trueOrFalse)
            NSLog(@"I lied. trueOrFalse is not true.");
        if (0)
            NSLog(@"This line should not appear.");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Unsurprisingly, the results are the same as above.

One important point to make here: if you only have one statement after the if(), you can just leave it like it is above. But if you have **more than one statement** after the if(), you **must enclose them within braces**:

```objc
if (trueOrFalse) {
    NSLog(@"trueOrFalse is true.");
    NSLog(@"This second line must be within the braces.");
}
```

Otherwise, the second (or additional) statements will be executed, regardless of if the condition was true or not.

Extending the if() Statement In real life though, there are often alternatives: if something is true, do "action1"; else, do "action2". Objective-C lets you model that quite simply:

```objc
trueOrFalse = YES;
if (trueOrFalse == YES)          // The double-equals sign is a comparison; versus a single equals, which is an assignment. More on this in the next Extension.
    NSLog(@"If true, print this");     // This gets printed
else
    NSLog(@"Else, print this");        // This does not get printed
trueOrFalse = NO;
if (trueOrFalse)
    NSLog(@"If true, print this");    // This does not get printed
else
    NSLog(@"Else, print this");       // This gets printed
```

Output is:

```
If true, print this
Else, print this
This makes logical sense.
```

You can also extend this by using else if(). This is easier to explain with code:

```objc
int value = 5;
if (value > 0)
    NSLog(@"value is greater than zero.");
else if (value == 0)
    NSLog(@"value is equal to zero.");
else
    NSLog(@"value is less than zero.");
```

Output is:

```
value is greater than zero.
```

You can have as many else if()s as you want; they simply follow each other:

```objc
int value = 5;
if (value == 6)
    NSLog(@"value is equal to 6.");
else if (value == 0)
    NSLog(@"value is equal to 0.");
else if (value == 2)
    NSLog(@"value is equal to 2.");
else if (value == 10)
    NSLog(@"value is equal to 10.");
else
    NSLog(@"value does not equal 6, 0, 2, or 10");     // This line is the output.
```

### Pitfalls

There are a few issues that may arise with if()statements.

* **Forgetting braces:** If you have more than one statement that you want to execute given a certain condition, you must enclose them within curly braces.

* **Using too many instances of if():** If you want to have a collection of related paths (if…else if…else), you must remember to use else if(). Using a chain of if()s is a completely different thing, logically. Think about it.

* **Forgetting the last else:** The final else is a “catchall” statement that is executed if none of the previous if() or else if() statements are true. Don’t forget the else; otherwise, you may never get any output. For example, in the last code example, the last else statement was needed; otherwise, it might have appeared that the code was broken.

### Conclusion

As you can see, the if() statement is quite simple, but very powerful- it defines “paths” down which your code can travel, based on the value of a condition. In the next Extension, we will be looking at what these conditions can be.
